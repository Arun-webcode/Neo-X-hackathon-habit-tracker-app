# Web3 Fitness Habit Formation App

## Overview

This app leverages Web3 technology to solve the issues of unreliable workout tracking, lack of data ownership, and limited rewards in current fitness apps. By decentralizing data storage and using blockchain for workout verification, we provide users with control over their data and meaningful rewards for workout consistency.

## Problem Statement

1. _Unreliable Tracking:_ Users can fake workout completion in traditional apps.
2. _Lack of Ownership:_ Users have no control over how fitness data is used or stored.
3. _Limited Rewards:_ Current rewards lack real-world value and are easily manipulated.

## Features

1. _Habit Tracking with Verification:_
   - GPS and video metadata confirm workouts.
   - Community validation through DAO ensures authenticity.
2. _Decentralized Data Ownership:_

   - Users control their data and can choose to sell or share it.
   - Data is securely stored on the blockchain.

3. _Reward System:_
   - Users earn tokens for consistent workouts.
   - Special NFTs awarded for major milestones, like a 30-day streak.
4. _Decentralized Storage with IPFS:_
   - Secure and tamper-proof storage for workout videos and metadata.

## Technologies

- _Blockchain:_ Neo and NeoX for smart contracts and cross-chain functionality.
- _IPFS:_ For decentralized storage of user data.
- _DAO:_ Decentralized governance for workout validation.
- _Geolocation APIs:_ For verifying workout locations.
- _NFTs and Tokens:_ For rewarding consistent fitness activity.
